# Function 
The function is a block of code that does task and we use it
for reusable the code and organizing our code 

## syntax 
there is two syntax in function 
The first one 
* ### Function declaration

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
  return
}
name();

 function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs

The code inside the function will execute when "something" call function when we wite thefunction name with simcomma
* ###  Function expression.

var x = function(y) {
   return y * y;
};

The main differnt between two syntax is the declaration you can call the function at the begin of code and at the end but expression you can just put the call at the end of code
