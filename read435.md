# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of ```nods``` that call ```vertices``` potentially connected by line segments named ```edges```.

## Common terminology used when working with Graphs:

- ```Vertex```: A vertex, also called a nod, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- ```Edge```: An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- ```Neighbor```: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- ```Degree```: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Types of graphs:

1) Undirected Graphs
It is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.


2) Directed Graphs (Digraph)
It Has a direction so eache vertex is directed at another vertex with a specific requirement of what vertex should be referenced next.


## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

The type of graph depends on how connected the graphs are to other vertices.

1) Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

2) Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices have at least one edge.

3) Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
