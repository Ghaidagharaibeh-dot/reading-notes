JavaScript JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers learned,it used to program the behavior of web pages.
binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. 
 A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.


 ## Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

 
 ## How we use 
 Ther is two way External and Internal
 1-we using spripte tag in HTMLA <spripte></spripte>

 2-External by connct HtML with JS using this syntex <script src=""> write the path in double qoutation 

 The best place of sj connection in footer in both external and internal 

## Data types:
## String:
 any set or any text of character between double or single quotes (number insid string its consider text)

it's something to sort value 
EX x=5 
## operaters: symbol or sign  
 operaters in JavaScript

5-Logical operators

## Condition statment :
 logical statment that's the way we can control of your code 
syntex IF(condition){code}
else 

if condition is true it will run the code if false it will ignor the code 
if I have more than condition we use tis syntex

If (condition){code}
else if (condition){code}

   ..
   ..
   ..
   
   else {}
   ## Console
