# What is Spring Boot

 project  built on the top of the Spring framework and provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.

# Advantages of Spring Boot
- It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be started using Java -jar.
- It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.
- It provides opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.
- It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health - checks, and externalized configuration. There is no requirement for XML configuration.
- It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
- It offers the number of plug-ins.
- It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.
- It increases productivity and reduces development time.

# Getting starting with spring:
### git clone
- cd gs-serving-web-content/initial

- Jump ahead to Create a Web Controller.
When you finish, you can check your results against the code in gs-serving-web-content/complete

### Starting with Spring Initializr

- If you use Gradle, visit the Spring Initializr to generate a new project with the required dependencies (Spring Web, Thymeleaf, and Spring Boot DevTools).

#### Spring Boot Devtools
To speed up this refresh cycle, Spring Boot offers with a handy module known as spring-boot-devtools. Spring Boot Devtools:

- Enables hot swapping(replace without rebooting the system).
- Switches template engines to disable caching.
- Enables LiveReload to automatically refresh the browser.
