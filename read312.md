|table based databases|databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|have predefined schema|have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
|databases are vertically scalable |horizontally scalable|
| increasing the horse-power of the hardware|scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.|
|databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.|
