# Tables
There are several types of information
that need to be displayed in a grid or
table.For example: sports results, stock
reports, train timetables.
## Basic Table Structure
- ### table tage 
The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
-  ### tr tage 
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening tr tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
td elements (one for each cell
in that row).
-  ### td tage
Each cell of a table is
represented using a td
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
- ### th tage
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row.

## Spanning Column
The **colspan** attribute can be
used on a th or td element
and indicates how many columns
that cell should run across.
## Spanning Row
The **rowspan** attribute can be
used on a th or td element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.
## Long Tables
There are three elements that
help distinguish between the
main content of the table and
the first and last rows (which can
contain different content).
- ### thead
The headings of the table should
sit inside the thead element. 
- ### tbody
The body should sit inside the
tbody element.
- ### tfoot
The footer belongs inside the
tfoot element.
# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem  which mean 
Domain modeling helps us to identify the
relevant concepts and ideas of a domain done  during object-oriented
analysis
