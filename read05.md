## Logical operater:
There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT. there are four logical operator in modern code you
 can use the new Nullish coalescing operator (??) that works like ||,
 but it only returns the second expression, when the first one is "nullish"

| Operator      | Name |Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |------|
| &&   | Logical and	      |Returns true if both statements are true | 
| اا   | Logical or	      |Returns true if one of the statements is true|
|!|Logical not	|Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true
# Loops
### FOR and WHILE
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

1-for statement

2-do...while statement

3-while statement

4-labeled statement

5-break statement

6-continue statement

7-for...in statement

8-for...of statement

# FOR 
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

## syntex
for (statt 1; stat 2; stat 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

* initialExpression :stat 1
* conditionExpression : stat 2 
* incrementExpression : stat 3 




# while

A while statement executes its statements as long as a
 specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

## syntex
while (condition){statement}

it like if statment syntex
