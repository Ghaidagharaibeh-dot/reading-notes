# OO Design

# Don’t repeat yourself

“Don’t repeat yourself” 

The principle of reducing repetition in software patterns and  replac it with abstractions or using data normalization.repetition in code  waste  time,performance and space. The role was formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas who applied it to include databases schemas, test plans, documentation and more, when applied successfully, modification of any element within the system shouldn’t require any modifications for logically unrelated elements.

# Rule of Three

Is a principle  state that if the code hav three or more instances of similar code, the code should be refactored using a new procedure.this principle was developedby Martin Fowler.
a principle that states that a programmer should not add functionality to the code until deemed required.and  was found in Extreme Programming (a software development methodology), which states that “Always implement things when you actually need them not when you just forsee that you need them”.

# Minimum viable product

A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle in industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.

Because the agile methodology is built on validating and iterating products based on user input, the MVP plays a central role in agile developmen
