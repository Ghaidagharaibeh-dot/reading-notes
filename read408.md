# OO Design

# Don’t repeat yourself

“Don’t repeat yourself” 

reducing repetition in software patterns and replac it with abstractions or using data normalization.beacuse repetition in code  waste  time,performance and space.  and the role was applied it to include databases schemas, test plans, documentation and more, when applied successfully  modification of any element within the system didn't require any modifications for logically unrelated elements.

# Rule of Three

 if the code have three or more instances of similar code, the code  refactored using a new procedure.
a principle that states that a programmer should not add functionality to the code until deemed required.and  was found in Extreme Programming (a software development methodology), which states that “Always implement things when you actually need them not when you just forsee that you need them”.

# Minimum viable product(MVP)

  is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle in industries .
  the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback  quickly to iterate and improve the product.

Because the agile methodology is built on validating and iterating products based on user input, the MVP plays a central role in agile developmen.
