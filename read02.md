# Sructural markup
 The elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
# Semantic markup
which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages — they are known as 

# Headings
HTML has six "levels" of
headings: 
h1 tage is used for main headings
h2 tage is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
h3 tage element is used, and so
on..

# paragraph
p tage
To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening p
tag and closing /p tag. 

# Bold & Italic 
 b tage 
 y enclosing words in the tags
b and /b we can make
characters appear bold.
The b element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the b element does not imply
any additional meaning.

i tage 
By enclosing words in the tags
i and /i we can make
characters appear italic.
The i element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content — such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.

# Superscript & Subscrip
sup
The sup element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22
.
sub
The sub element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H2
0.
