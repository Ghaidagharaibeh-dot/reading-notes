the page you are linking to.

email address in the "to" field.

 # WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
 Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. 

- Methods: represent tasks that are associated with
the object. For example, you can check how many
rooms are available by subtracting the number of
booked rooms from the total number of rooms.
