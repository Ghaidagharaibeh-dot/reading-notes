# Java
##  Language Basics
- variable 
Variable is used to store value
1)Instance Variables(Non-Static Fields): their values are unique to each instance of a class

2)Class Variables (Static Fields):any field declared with the static modifier

3)Local Variables :declared within the state of the object itself (Locally) and are only accessible to the methods and not the rest of the classes.

4)Parameters 


*Naming in JAVA*
 1) case-sensitive lanaguge
 2) you can naming with latter,digitsand two special characters but you can't start your name with a numbers
 3) reserved  word not allow like int string ...ect
 4) If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word
5) White space is not allowed


- Operators

The operators in  works with 

Following the descending precedence from higher precedence to lower:

| Operators	     | Precedence  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| postfix	| expr++ expr--  |
| unary	|++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !|
| multiplicative		| * / %|
| additive		| + -  |
| shift		| << >> >>>  |
|relational		| < > <= >= instanceof |
| equality		| == !=  |
| bitwise AND		|^ |
| bitwise inclusive OR		| !  |
| logical AND		| &&  |
| logical OR			| || |
| ternary		| ? : |
| assignment			| = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=  |





- Expressions, Statements, and Blocks.

1) Expressions:a construct that use operators, variables, and method invocations, an expression returns Boolean data

2) Statements : a complete unit of execution terminating the expression with a semicolon (;).

### Example 

// assignment statement

aValue = 8933.234;

// increment statement

aValue++;

// method invocation statement

System.out.println("Hello World!");

// object creation statement

Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();


3) A block : is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

- Control Flow Statements

1) This section describes the decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch)

2) The looping statements (for, while, do-while)

3) The branching statements (break, continue, return) supported by the Java programming language.
