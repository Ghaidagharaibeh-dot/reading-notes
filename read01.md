# HTML structure
HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value.
X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
# EXTRA MARKUP
X DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
X You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
X The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
X The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
X <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
X The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
X Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
# HTML5 LAYOUT
X The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
X The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

# PROCESS & Design
 It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
X Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
X Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
X Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
X You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
X You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present

# Js structure
A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
